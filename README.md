## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

Flooding poses a significant threat to communities worldwide, exacerbated by climate change and urbanization. Many individuals, especially those in vulnerable populations, lack timely information to prepare for flood events, leading to loss of life and property damage.

### How our technology solution can help

Our solution provides timely, actionable flood alerts and resource information

### Our idea

Our solution is an innovative solution designed to address the critical issue of flooding through the integration of advanced predictive analytics and real-time data collection. Flooding events are increasing in frequency and severity, impacting millions globally, particularly in low-income communities that often lack access to timely and reliable information. Traditional flood warning systems can be slow to provide updates or may fail to reach the most vulnerable populations. FloodGuard seeks to fill this gap by leveraging AI technology to deliver proactive, user-friendly flood alerts and resource access.


## Technology implementation

### IBM watsonx product(s) used

_INSTRUCTIONS: Included here is a list of IBM watsonx products. Remove any products you did not use. Leave only those included in your solution code. In your official submission on the Call for Code Global Challenge web site, you are required to provide details on where and how you used each IBM watsonx product so judges can review your implementation. Remove these instructions._

**Featured watsonx products**

- [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) - Utilized for predictive analytics, analyzing vast datasets to forecast flood risks accurately.

- [watsonx.governance](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance) - Ensures data integrity and compliance, managing data usage and privacy throughout the project.

- [watsonx Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watsonx-assistant) - Provides a conversational interface for users to access information and report local conditions easily.

### Other IBM technology used

INSTRUCTIONS: List any other IBM technology or IBM AI services used in your solution and describe how each component was used. If you can provide details on where these were used in your code, that would help the judges review your submission.

**Additional IBM AI services (Remove any that you did not use)**

- [Watson Machine Learning](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-machine-learning) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [Watson Studio](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-studio) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [Natural Language Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/speech-to-text) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/text-to-speech) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [Language Translator](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/language-translator) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

### Solution architecture

REPLACE THIS EXAMPLE WITH YOUR OWN, OR REMOVE THIS EXAMPLE

Diagram and step-by-step description of the flow of our solution:

![Video transcription/translaftion app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Presentation materials

_INSTRUCTIONS: The following deliverables should be officially posted to your My Team > Submissions section of the [Call for Code Global Challenge resources site](https://cfc-prod.skillsnetwork.site/), but you can also include them here for completeness. Replace the examples seen here with your own deliverable links._
